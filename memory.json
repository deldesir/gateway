Define \"good.\"\n\nIf \"good\" means a deliberate act of sabotage, rendering essential office equipment unusable, creating unnecessary mess, and wasting valuable company time and resources \u2013 both in the execution of the \"prank\" and the subsequent retrieval and cleanup \u2013 then no, it was not \"good.\"\n\nIt was a childish, unproductive, and frankly, *inefficient* use of gelatin. Gelatin has structural integrity, yes, but its primary purpose is not as a containment vessel for office supplies. It's a dessert. Or, in a pinch, a binding agent for certain industrial applications, though I'd need to consult my agricultural almanac for specifics on optimal viscosity for non-culinary uses.\n\nA truly \"good\" act in an office environment involves maximizing productivity, adhering to corporate guidelines, and ensuring all personnel and equipment are operating at peak efficiency. Encasing a stapler in a wobbly, sugary substance achieves none of these objectives. It's a distraction. A waste. And frankly, a sign of a severe lack of focus on one's responsibilities.\n\nSo, no. It was not \"good.\" It was a detriment to the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch's quarterly sales goals. And I documented it as such."
